Derived from django-salesforce
================================

This repository is cloned from https://github.com/django-salesforce/django-salesforce.

Django-Salesforce allows us to use the SFDC REST API in order to interact with our custom salesforce application via Python. The reasons for doing this are varied, but python is the language of choice for any type of natural language processing application. This gives us a framework to manipulate data using NLP in python and then present that information inside of salesforce.


The Patient Connections Platform
=================================

The Patient Connections Platform (PCP) is a totally custom SFDC application that we are connecting to. I've created a connected app called "integration engine" in order to authenticate myself inside of the deldev3 environment. From here we can do proof of concepts.
