"""
simplified Python DB API 2.0 for Salesforce - (independent on Django)

A basic SQL SELECT and a small part of PEP 0249 will be implemented here.
Only SELECT command is currently implemented.
Transactions will be never implemented.
SQL commands INSERT and UPDATE could be implemented easily, but it is not
currently important because the current object implementation is good enough.

Purpose:
Splitting Django-Salesforce to a high level part that depends on Django
(especially on a Django version) and a low level part that depends
on Salesforce (but not on Django) has to be better for development,
maintenance and testing.
