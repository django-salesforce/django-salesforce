"""
A set of tools to deal with Salesforce actions that
cannot or can hardly be implemented using the generic
relational database abstraction.

The Salesforce REST API is missing a few endpoints that
are available in the SOAP API. We are using `beatbox` as
a workaround for those specific actions (such as Lead-Contact
conversion).

    """
    Convert `lead` using the `convertLead()` endpoint exposed
    by the SOAP API.

    The parameter `lead` is expected to be a Lead object that
    has not been converted yet.

    kwargs: additional optional parameters like `accountId` if the Lead should
        be merged with an existing Account. More info in
    https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_convertlead.htm

    -- BEWARE --
    The current implementation won't work in case your `Contact`,
    `Account` or `Opportunity` objects have some custom **and**
    required fields. This arises from the fact that `convertLead()`
    is only meant to deal with standard Salesforce fields, so it does
    not really care about populating custom fields at insert time.

    One workaround is to map a custom required field in
    your `Lead` object to every custom required field in the target
    objects (i.e., `Contact`, `Opportunity` or `Account`). Follow the
    instructions at

    https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=customize_mapleads.htm
